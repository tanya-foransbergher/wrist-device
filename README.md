# Electronic device for wrist rehabilitation
The wrist functionality recovery device utilizes continuous
passive motion therapy, driven by a stepper motor. Control is
achieved via an Arduino Uno R3 development board, using
digital/analog signals to manage motor direction and speed
across four operating modes. The system is programmed with
the Arduino IDE for precise motor control, valued for its userfriendly interface and versatility.
